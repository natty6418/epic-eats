An Example User:

  recepies: // an array of references to Recepies,
  savedRecepies: // an array of references to Recepies,
  followers: // an array of references to Users,
  following: // an array of references to Users,

  ingredients: // an array of strings,
  instructions: // a string,
  image: // a reference to an Image,
  comments: // an array of references to Comments
