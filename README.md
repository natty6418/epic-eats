An Example User:

  email: // a unique identifier for the user,
  password: // a password hash,
  recepies: // an array of references to Recepies,
  savedRecepies: // an array of references to Recepies,
  followers: // an array of references to Users,
  following: // an array of references to Users,
  profilePic: // a reference to an Image
}
```

An Example Recepie:

```javascript
{
  userId: // a reference to a User id,
  title: "Chocolate Cake",
  description: "A delicious chocolate cake",
  ingredients: // an array of strings,
  instructions: // a string,
  image: // a reference to an Image,
  comments: // an array of references to Comments
